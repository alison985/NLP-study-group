JOB DESCRIPTION
77 West Wacker Dr (35012), United States of America, Chicago, Illinois


At Capital One, we’re building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.   
Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.

Data Scientist -Speech Recognition


Capital One is a diversified bank that offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small business and commercial clients. Ranked #127 on the Fortune 500, Capital One has one of the most widely recognized brands in America. As one of the nation’s top 10 banks, we offer a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. We nurture a work environment where people with a variety of thoughts, ideas and backgrounds, guided by our shared Values, come together to make Capital One a great company and a great place to work.   
  
At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.   

As a Data Scientist at Capital One US Card, you'll be part of a team that's designing and developing the core speech recognition technology used across Capital One. Your work will encompass the whole scope of application development, including audio processing, speech recognition pipeline, prototyping, and operating across billions of customers’ phone calls to unlock the big opportunity that help us listen to our customers.
  
On any given day you’ll be: 
-Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of unstructured data, for example, speech/audio, image, and/or textual data 
-Creating machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production   
-Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders   
-Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of mobile banking and the financial world of tomorrow 
-Using Hadoop and related tools (Pig, Hive, Impala) to manage the analysis of billions of customer transaction records 
  
The Ideal Candidate will be…   
-Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea. You probably have a diploma and an impressive GPA, or you dropped out of college, taught yourself and routinely win Kaggle competitions.   
-Wrangler. You know how to move data around, from a database or an API, through a transformation or two, a model and into human-readable form (ROC curve, Excel chart, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.). You probably know Python, Java, R, Storm, Julia, SQL, Matlab, Mahout, or think everything can be done in a Perl one-liner.   
-Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what you’ve shipped and what’s flopped.   
-Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.   
  
Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it’s still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest folks you’ve ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference. 

Basic Qualifications: 
-At least a Master’s Degree and a minimum of 2 years’ experience OR a Bachelor’s Degree and a minimum of 6 years of experience
